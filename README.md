This project is still in early development

Please keep the following in mind:

1) Some features will require the user to provide game files.  Details can be
   found in the manual.

2) The UI is disgusting.  It is temporary and mainly for testing purposes.  It is
   usable in it's current state, but will be replaced with a cleaner UI in the future.

3) The current feature list is short.  But will be expanding as quickly as possible.

4) I am still learning python and have been using chatgpt to aid in my journey.
   Most of it's use has been asking questions, but some of the code was written
   by chatgpt.  This means between me still learning and AI being far from perfect,
   the code is probably pretty inefficient, and the comments and formatting are all
   over the place.  I hope to remedy these issues as I improve with python and rely
   less on AI.

Current feature list:

Figurines
- Edit a mod to change which in game item it replaces
- Shows a preview of the selected game item (Requires game files)
- Automatically rescale mod to match the size of the newly effected game item
  (Requires game files)

Comics
- Edit a mod to change which comic volume it replaces
